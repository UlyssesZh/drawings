# Drawings

These pictures are all drawn by myself.

## Purpose

These pictures are mainly used as personal avatars for online users.
Some of them are drawn for myself,
and others are drawn for the orders of people (called *orderers*) who want me to draw something for them.

## Tools

The tool I use is [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
I uses [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) to convert them into PNG or JPEG formats.

## Terms of use

All the pictures can be non-commercially used for free and without any informing
under any of the following circumstances:

- to refer to / link to / advertise the orderer;
- as samples for illustrating image processing techniques;
- as examples of my arts.

You cannot use these pictures for any of the following circumstances
unless the orderer tells you otherwise:

- to be included (whether directly or indirectly) in anything commercial;
- to create derivate artworks;
- to use as the symbol of anything else than the orderer themself.

You should contact the orderer for any questions.
If you cannot find the contact information about the orderer, contact me instead.

## Be an orderer

If you are interested in letting me drawing something for you (for free, definitely),
you can [contact me by email](mailto:ulysseszhan@gmail.com) as long as you agree with the terms of use above.
I can draw for you if I have spare time.
